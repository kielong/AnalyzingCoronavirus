# Analyzing News Articles About the Coronavirus
## Overview: 
This project uses state of the art deep learning techniques to analyze the news coverage of the coronavirus. The dataset I analyzed contains 2 million news articles written in 20 languages and published in 50,000 venues around the world.

The following deep learning concepts were implemented:
1. explainability
2. attention (compared with RNNs and CNNs)
3. transfer learning/fine tuning
4. embeddings
5. data cleaning techniques
6. using Unicode in both English and foreign language text
7. "natural supervision" to generate labels for unlabeled data
